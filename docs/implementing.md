# How to Implement DataSeal

## Requirements

DataSeal is built using Django and runs behind a proxy server on Nginx. DataSeal uses PostgreSQL in production. DataSeal has been tested and deployed in Ubuntu 14.04, but can operate on any Unix-based Server. In production, DataSeal will require an SSL certificate. Finally, DataSeal requires an Internet Archive API Key for uploading documents.
